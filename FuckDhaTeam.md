# Some Incidents of DHA Team Maliciously Attacking My Server

## Main Character: DHA-アサ獅子

### First Attack: 6/20

On June 20th, my public server [https://dhs.moeyy.cn](https://dhs.moeyy.cn) and other websites were attacked. The day before, on June 19th, DHA's public server was officially launched by Mr. Shishi using AI-generated scripts.

#### Attack Log of My Website:

#### DHA Public Server Launch:

When I checked the IP, it seemed familiar. Isn't it from the same school as Mr. Shishi? To verify, I looked into the previous login IPs when Shishi used our server.

#### IP Comparison:

- Shishi's login IP: 223.87.156.143
- Attacker's IP: 220.166.50.62

Both IPs are from the same location: Southwestern University of Finance and Economics, Tianfu College (Mianyang Campus).

Thus, I confronted Mr. Shishi:

Skipping the small talk, Mr. Shishi eventually admitted to the attack after I mentioned reporting the attacker's IP to the university. He offered to compensate for my losses and clarified that it wasn’t my server that was DDoS attacked. He admitted his wrongdoing, and we didn’t pursue the matter further.

### Second Attack: 9/4

TSG team launched a new website offering free plugins and control panel software, which probably upset DHA. Mr. Shishi attacked our server again.

At 16:48, I posted the patch download link: [https://tsg-patch.moeyy.cn](https://tsg-patch.moeyy.cn). By 16:57, Mr. Shishi began scouting my webpage using mobile 4G to hide his IP.

After scouting, he initiated the first attack at around 17:45 using a Japanese IP: 31.223.184.91. The attack had no effect due to frequency limits. Afterward, I blocked access from outside mainland China, except for Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan.

He then attempted an attack using a Hong Kong IP, which was again blocked by frequency limits. Eventually, I discovered his real IP: 112.44.90.15 and confronted him in DC.

He carelessly exposed his own IP:

- Shishi’s exposed IP: 111.55.148.162
- Attacker's IP: 112.44.90.15

Upon checking, both IPs were from nearly identical locations, less than 1 km apart. The evidence clearly points to Mr. Shishi as the attacker. Despite undeniable proof, he continues to deny it.

### Conclusion:

In DHA, there are a few bad apples who either develop cheats or attack servers. Mr. Shishi is one of them.
