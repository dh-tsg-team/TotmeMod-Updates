# Some Incidents of DHA Team Maliciously Attacking My Server

## Main Character: `DHA-アサ獅子`

### First Attack: 6/20

On June 20th, my server [https://dhs.moeyy.cn](https://dhs.moeyy.cn) and other websites were under attacked. The day before, on June 19th, DHA's public server(**shit**) was launched by `アサ獅子` using AI-generated scripts.

#### DHA Public Server Launch:

I checked the IP which is familiar with the one from where `アサ獅子` studied? To verify my assumption, I checked the previous login IPs when `アサ獅子` logged our server.
Because he was once a member of our team and logged into our server, we can trace his login IP.

#### IP Comparison:

- `アサ獅子`'s login IP: 223.87.156.143
- Attacker's IP: 220.166.50.62

Both IPs are belonging to the same location: Southwestern University of Finance and Economics, Tianfu College (Mianyang Campus).

Thus, I confronted `アサ獅子`:

Skipping the small talk, ``アサ獅子 eventually admitted to the attack after I mentioned reporting the attacker's IP to the university. He offered to compensate for my losses. He admitted his wrongdoing so that we didn’t pursue the matter further.

### Second Attack: 9/4

TSG team launched a new website offering free plugins and control panel, which probably upset DHA. `アサ獅子` attacked our server again.

At 16:48, I posted the patch download link: [https://tsg-patch.moeyy.cn](https://tsg-patch.moeyy.cn). By 16:57, `アサ獅子` began scouting my webpage and tried to use mobile data to hide his IP.

After scouting, he initiated the first attack at around 17:45 using a Japanese IP: 31.223.184.91. The attack had no effect due to frequency limits. Afterward, I blocked all requests expect for mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan.

He then attempted to attack using a Hong Kong IP, which was again blocked by frequency limits. Eventually, I discovered his real IP: 112.44.90.15 and confronted him in DC.

He carelessly leaked his private IP (mobile network)

- `アサ獅子`'s real IP: 111.55.148.162
- Attacker's IP: 112.44.90.15

Upon checking, both IPs were from nearly identical locations, less than 1 km apart. The evidence clearly points to `アサ獅子` as the attacker. Despite undeniable proof, he continued to deny it.

### Conclusion:

In DHA, there are a few bad apples who develop cheats and attack servers. `アサ獅子` is one of them.
